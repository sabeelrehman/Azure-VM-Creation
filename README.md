# Azure-VM-Creation
In this lab, I deploy an Azure VM using the Azure portal by creating a resource group, selecting the region, VM size and OS (operating system), and configuring basic networking settings. I then complete the deployment and verify that the VM is successfully created and running. 
The purpose of this project is to gain hands-on experience with Azure computer, understand VM deployment workflows and build foundational cloud infrastructure skills.
